# Hello World

This blog is now powered by **Next.js App Router** and reads content directly from the `contents/` directory.

## Features

- **SSR**: Fast initial load and SEO friendly.
- **Local Files**: Easy to manage content with Git.
- **Minimal Design**: Focused on reading experience.

You can add more `.md` or `.mdx` files to the `contents` folder to create new posts.
